			<p>We are delighted to offer on-campus accommodation and dining packages to competitors, coaches, and chaperones through USC's residential dorms, <a href="https://housing.usc.edu/index.php/buildings/mccarthy-honors-residential-college/">McCarthy (USC Village)</a> and <a href="https://housing.usc.edu/index.php/buildings/arts-humanities-residential-college-at-parkside/">Parkside</a>. Dorms and dining halls will require a visitor card to access, which can be picked up at check-in.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Registration & Payment</b>
					<p>Housing can be reserved, on a <b><em>first-come, first-served basis, with reservations limited to coaches, students, and the required number of chaperones.</em></b> Teams will have to register for an account through the USC reservation portal sent to coaches through email, list all the members who plan on going, and pay a reservation fee. USC Housing will reach out for further details once an official reservation is made. The website will prompt different housing plans and pricing based on the selected arrival date.</p>
					<p>In the event you need to update or add additional guests to an existing registration, choose "Edit Registration" to make the changes. If you need to create a new, separate reservation, select "New Registration" and use <em>USC-SONT</em> as your code. For further assistance with registration, please reach out to USC Housing Conference Services, <a href="mailto:summerco@usc.edu">summerco@usc.edu</a>.</p>
