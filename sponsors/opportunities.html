			<p>On May 22&ndash;23, 2026, the <b>University of Southern California (USC)</b> will host one of the nation's largest and most prestigious science and technology competitions - the Science Olympiad National Tournament. This event will bring more than 5,000 students, educators, and parents to Los Angeles and showcase some of the brightest young minds in science and engineering at the middle and high school levels.</p>
			<p>Throughout the weekend, USC will highlight its national leadership in advancing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education for current and future generations. Competition Day will take place across USC's campus and feature a wide range of exciting activities and events.</p>
			<p>The University of Southern California Science Olympiad Alumni Chapter (SciBAT) is seeking corporate sponsors to help maximize the opportunity to elevate and inspire young scientific talent and to encourage those future innovators to consider USC for their higher education.</p>
