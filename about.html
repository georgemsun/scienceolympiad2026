			<p>Welcome to the <b>2026 Science Olympiad National Tournament</b>, hosted by the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California (USC)</a> with the support of <a href="https://soinc.org/">Science Olympiad</a>. This tournament represents the highest level of science competition for middle and high schools across the nation, while also featuring Science Olympiad's Global Ambassador Team from Japan, bringing together more than 2,000 student competitors to Los Angeles!</p>

			<h2 id="collaboration">Theme: Collaboration</h2>
			<p>This year's theme, <em>Collaboration</em>, is deeply intertwined with the culture of USC and is perpetuated by the welcoming community in California. The spirit of teamwork and innovation can be seen in the interdisciplinary efforts of Hollywood to produce films and music, as well as in the thriving startup ecosystem at USC that has launched companies like <a href="https://www.lucasfilm.com">Lucasfilm</a>, <a href="https://www.relativityspace.com">Relativity Space</a>, and <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en">Riot Games</a>. We hope that Science Olympiad and USC together will embody the same spirit of collaboration, fostering creativity and discovery that empowers the next generation of scientists and engineers.</p>

			<p>The running of the tournament is the culmination of the work of hundreds of Southern California students and Science Olympiad alumni from across the nation who have supported the various tournaments USC has hosted since the official start of its Science Olympiad Alumni Chapter in 2023. Our students have long envisioned welcoming schools from across the country to our campus, and we are thrilled to serve as the host site of scientific exploration and innovation for this year's National Tournament.</p>
			<p>As the first in-person National Tournament to be hosted in the <a href="https://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/state-symbols/nickname-golden-state/">Golden State</a>, we are excited to welcome students to the city of Los Angeles, home to the iconic Hollywood sign, numerous championship-winning sports teams such as the Dodgers and the Lakers, and our USC campus.</p>

			<h2 id="mission">Our Mission</h2>
			<p>USC Science Olympiad aims to uphold the tradition of providing teams with a high-quality, thought-provoking competition experience at the highest caliber in the country. By participating in the 2026 Science Olympiad National Tournament, we hope competitors not only feel challenged as they strive for excellence in their events but also develop stronger bonds with their teammates.
