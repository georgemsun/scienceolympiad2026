				<p>There are many things that make the National Tournament a memorable experience, one of which is being able to compete against students from across the country. During the Opening Ceremony of the National Tournament, the annual Parade of States showcases and celebrates the teams in attendance and provides a space for them to show their state pride!</p>
				<p>Teams are encouraged to select <em>up to four individuals (maximum)</em> for the Parade of States. You are encouraged to bring a school banner/flag and a state flag for the parade (these are encouraged, not required). Many schools dress up for the parade as something that represents their school/region/state; this is encouraged, not required.</p>
				<p><em>Please note: No items may be thrown into the audience. No inflatables are permitted.</em></p>
